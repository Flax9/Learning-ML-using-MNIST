# Handwritten Digit Classifier using MNIST

This project is a simple Machine Learning application that uses a Neural Network to identify handwritten digits (0-9). It is trained on the classic MNIST dataset.

## 📊 Project Overview
The application reads raw binary data from MNIST `.gz` files, processes them into images, and uses TensorFlow/Keras to train a model that can predict the number written in an image with high accuracy.


## 🛠️ Features
* **Custom Data Loader**: Directly reads local `.gz` idx-ubyte files.
* **Neural Network**: Simple Dense layers with ReLU and Softmax activation.
* **Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib to display the image along with its predicted label.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**:
